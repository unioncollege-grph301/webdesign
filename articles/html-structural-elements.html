 <p>In HTML4 div and span elements were used to separate content. HTML5 still supports these but has created more specific elements to help designers code their pages in a smarter way. Compatibility for HTML5 semantic elements is improving but is not ideal yet. There are several ways to make an older browser recognize new tags but many newer browsers will already support HTML5.</p> 

 <p>Nine of these new elements are section, article, nav, aside, header, footer, hgroup, time, and mark. Each of these is briefly explained below.</p>

 <ul>
   <li>Use the article element to separate distinct pieces of content. An example would be a news item or an article by a guest author.</li>
   <li>Section is used to section out a piece of content or a category of content. Article can be used inside section and vice versa depending out the situation.</li>
   <li>Nav would be used to contain the navigation menu of a page, as its name implies.</li>
   <li>Use aside for a pull quote or other piece of content that compliments the main content.</li>
   <li>Header and footer are pretty self-explanatory. Use them to contain the header and footer information of the page. Note that “header” is not the same as “head.”</li>
   <li>Hgroup is used to contain two or more headings. A title and subtitle could be combined this way to simplify the structure of the finished page.</li>
   <li>Time could be a useful element. It is used to write a time or date in a way that computers and humans can understand it.</li>
   <li>Mark is used for highlight something without changing the meaning of its content.</li>
 </ul>
