    <p align="justify">Towards the very end of the 20th century there was a new discovery.  There was the ability to share mass information using servers to other computers.  This gave rise to what we call today a web browser.</p>

    <h2>What is a web browser?</h2>  <hr /> 
    A web browser is a software program that allows people to search keywords and reference them with entire databases of information.  The very first web browser was created in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee, called the World Wide Web (WWW).  The World Wide Web uses many different languages to communicate and display information. These languages are HTML, HTTP, DNS, along with static and dynamic content.   HTML is a universal language used to create websites.  HTTP is the language that deciphers HTML information and converts it into a readable format.  HTTP sends requests to servers for permission to access that webpage.  DNS of domain name servers are what we commonly know and refer to as a web address or URL, usually linked to an IP address.  Each individual website uses a IP address to communicate to servers and connect to their websites. 
    
    <h2>Servers</h2> <hr />A server is a location that contains all the information to connect and create the requested website.  The server distributes the information to whoever is trying to access their website. 
 
    <h3>What does a browser consist of? </h3> <hr /> It consists of a User interface, Networking unit, Browser engine, Rendering engine, a UI backend, Javascript interpreter, and an area of data storage.
