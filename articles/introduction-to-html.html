            <h2> What is HTML?</h2>
            <p>
Hyper Text Markup Language, otherwise known as HTML, is a special way of creating documents, or websites, for use on the Internet.  Because it is a markup language, HTML defines what type of content is displayed on a webpage by “marking up” the document with elements known as tags. When a user visits the document, or site, a web browser will scan through the document and render its structure according to the tags contained in it. It is vital to understand HTML as it is the foundation for all websites and supporting languages such as CSS or JavaScript—without HTML, the browser will not be able to display any part of the website.

            <h2> HTML Structuring</h2>
            <p>
    When creating an HTML document, there are three things every HTML document has to have: a DOCTYPE! declaration, &lt;DOCTYPE! html&gt;; an HTML tag, &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt;; and a body tag, &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt;. The DOCTYPE! declaration tells the browser what type of document it is rendering. The &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt; tags tell the browser where the HTML respectively begins and ends. Similarly, the &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; tags show where the visible content of the document begins and ends.

            <h2> Tags & Attributes </h2>
            <p>
              Now, you are probably wondering: What on earth are tags? Tags are pieces of code that define the content of the page. The content within these tags are known as elements. Because tags are meant to contain content, each element has two tags—an opening tag and a closing tag. Here is an example showing the basic structure of an opening tag and a closing tag:
              <pre class="tag">
    &lt;body&gt;                    &lt;/body&gt;
    Opening tag         Closing tag
</pre>
              The less-than and greater-than symbols bracket the tag name, signaling the browser that a tag is there; in the closing tag, a forward slash is used to indicate the closing of the content of that tag. It is important to remember that there must be an opening and closing tag because without these tags, the content will not display the way you intend it to. <br/>
              In some cases, you may find that you want to specify the tag further. This is accomplished by the use of attributes. Some attributes such as class and id allow you to differentiate the tag from its generic form. Others such as src or href allow you to insert images or hyperlinks into the content of the tag. Each attribute is given a value, which could be a name or number; an example of an attribute is shown below.
              <pre class="attribute">
&lt;div class= “content”&gt;            
tag attribute value     
</pre>
              The attribute is declared after the tag name and the value is indicated by the quotation marks.
