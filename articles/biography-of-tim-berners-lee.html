<p>Tim Berners-Lee was born on the 8th of June, 1955 in London, England. He is currently well-known as World Web Wide inventor. After his graduation from the Queen's College at Oxford University with a degree in physics, he worked as an engineer at Plessey Telecommunications LTD in Poole. In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash Ltd. where he created the typesetting software for printers as well as a multitasking operating system.</p>

<p>After leaving D.G. Nash he worked at CERN for six months as a consultant software engineer. While working there, he got a chance to built “ENQUIRE”, a hypertext-based program used for future development of the World Wide Web. However, this program has never been published. Tim quit CERN in December 1980.</p>

<p>For three years he worked at John Poole's Image Computer Systems Ltd in England taking care of the company’s technical side. He returned to CERN in 1984 to work on distributed real-time systems for scientific data acquisition and system control.</p>

<p>In cooperation with Robert Cailliau, Tim wrote his initial proposal to create the World Wide Web in 1990. The very first web browser was then published followed by the first website (info.cern.ch) on 6 August 1991, which was available for visitors to learn about hypertext and WebPages.</p>

<p>In 1994, he founded World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and also served as director. W3C is an organization that defined web standards and recommendations to enhance the web quality which was followed by the first holder of 3Com Founders chair in 1999.</p>

<p>He was selected as a Professor of Computer Science at the University of South Hampton, England in December 2004. He was co-Director of the Web Science Trust, launched in 2006 as the Web Science Research Initiative, to help create the first multidisciplinary research body to examine the World Wide Web and provide solutions to help the development of it. Lee is currently the Director of the World Wide Web Foundation built in 2009 and also the 3COM Founders Professor of Engineering in the School of Engineering, as well as holding a position in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at CSAIL where he also heads the Decentralized Information Group.</p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee has received a lot of acknowledgments during his career including international awards. To name a few they are the Japan Prize, the Prince of Austria’s Foundation Prize, the Millennium Technology Prize, and Germany's Die Quadriga award. In 2004, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. In 2007 he was awarded the Order of Merit. In April 2009, he was elected a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences. Working together with Mark Fischetti, he wrote his book <em>“Weaving the Web”.</em></p>
